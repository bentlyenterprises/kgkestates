			<h2>Deer and Wildlife Stewardship at KGK Estates</h2>
			
			<h3>KGK Estateâ€™s Deer Management Principles</h3>
			<p>Native wild deer, particularly red deer, are an integral part of the ecosystems on KGK Estates. They have significant impacts on habitats and species through their trampling and grazing, making their numbers essential to manage. Deer also bring economic and employment benefits through venison production and guest stalking. Our aim is to manage deer populations through careful culling to encourage natural ecological processes.</p>
			
			<ul>
			  <li>KGK Estates welcomes visitors always; deer control practices will not impede public access.</li>
			  <li>Deer grazing impacts will be regularly monitored, and cull numbers will respond directly to these impacts.</li>
			  <li>Culling follows industry Best Practices concerning public safety, deer welfare, carcass hygiene, and record-keeping.</li>
			  <li>Non-lead ammunition is utilized to avoid contamination of carcasses for human consumption and prevent risk to other wildlife.</li>
			  <li>For environmental considerations, some culled deer carcasses will remain on the hill to minimize extraction damage and benefit other wildlife.</li>
			  <li>KGK Estates collaborates actively with neighbors to achieve sustainable deer management.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3>Wider Wildlife</h3>
			<p>KGK Estates is home to abundant wildlife including black and red grouse, goshawks, merlins, golden eagles, buzzards, red kites, golden plovers, mountain hare, brown hares, otters, peregrine falcons, pine martens, red and roe deer.</p>
			
			<p>Annual wildlife monitoring continues, conducted by our staff and external experts, particularly focused on keystone species such as wading birds, grouse, and raptors. We actively enhance habitats for wildlife through sensitive farming methods, woodland creation, and responsible deer population management.</p>
			
			<h3>The River</h3>
			<p>The River Don flows west to east across the southern end of the estates, providing 7.5 miles of double-bank fishing and 4.75 miles of single-bank fishing available by day or season tickets. The river supports diverse wildlife including Atlantic salmon, brown trout, ospreys, otters, dippers, goosanders, and numerous invertebrates.</p>
			
			<p>To further enhance this natural resource, we aim to move farming practices away from riverbanks, creating buffer zones to encourage riparian vegetation growth and natural river movement. Additionally, extensive riparian improvements are being implemented on tributaries feeding the Don, including planting small clusters of trees along banks and installing natural woody structures. These measures help slow water flow, create floodplains, and provide habitats beneficial for fish and invertebrate populations.</p>

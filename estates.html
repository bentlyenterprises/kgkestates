			<h2>The Estates</h2>
			<p>The Glenkindie and Kildrummy Estates in Aberdeenshire are treasured landmarks with deep historical roots, dating back many centuries. Kildrummy Castle, constructed around 1245, served as the seat for the Earls of Mar and has witnessed significant moments in Scottish history. While the original medieval castle now lies in atmospheric ruins cared for by Historic Scotland, the early 20th-century Kildrummy Castle Hotel, designed by renowned architect Alexander Marshall Mackenzie, reflects the estate's Edwardian elegance.</p>

			<p>Similarly steeped in history, Glenkindie Estate boasts Glenkindie Castle, an iconic property with a storied past nestled within a landscape rich in beauty and tranquility. Together, these estates represent an important part of Aberdeenshire's heritage, celebrated not only for their historical architecture but also for their commitment to sustainable stewardship and community involvement.</p>

			<p>Under the thoughtful ownership of Christopher and Camille Bently, both estates have undergone sensitive renovations designed to preserve their historic charm while enhancing their ecological sustainability. These improvements demonstrate a deep respect for local tradition and environment, ensuring the estates will continue to thrive for future generations.</p>

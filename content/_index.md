  <p>
    In the heart of Aberdeenshire, Kildrummy and Glenkindie estates are undergoing
	quiet but meaningful transformation. Rich in history and rooted in the community,
	these lands are now guided by a vision for restoration: of ecosystems, of historic
	spaces, and of the connections between people and place.
  </p>
    <p>
    Kildrummy and Glenkindie together span thousands of acres of woodlands,
farmlands, rivers, and historic structures. Kildrummy Castle, once the stronghold of
the Earls of Mar, and Glenkindie Castle, a 16th-century home reimagined in the Arts
and Crafts style, anchor the land with a sense of deep time. Today, the estate holds
more than ruins and rose beds—it holds new life.
The hills that once echoed with sport shooting are now home to a different kind of
care. Grouse moors are being reimagined as biodiverse woodlands. Sitka spruce
plantations are giving way to native species. Salmon run again in the River Don, and
deer no longer face management for sport, but are part of a balanced ecosystem.

      <h3>Restoration in Action</h3>
      <p>Rewilding here is not just about letting nature take over. It’s an active process of repair. Species that once vanished are now being given the conditions to return. Hunting and trapping have ended. Tracts of land long altered for commercial gain are now being restored to complex, living systems that sustain flora, fauna, and carbon alike.</p>
      <p>This is not conservation for conservation’s sake. It’s about creating a more resilient future, ecologically, economically, and socially. Wind turbines continue to generate clean energy. Historic buildings are restored with care. Local employment is stronger than before, with new roles in land management, restoration, and hospitality.</p>

### Community at the Centre
<p>While the land has changed hands over the centuries, what remains constant is the
presence and pride of the local community. That’s why the work on these estates is
done in collaboration with local partners, schools, artisans, and neighbours. Events like the Kildrummy Rally bring people together to celebrate the area’s energy and
resilience.
</p>
<p>We warmly welcome visitors to stroll through the whimsical yew topiary and rose
beds of Glenkindie’s gardens, take in a bonsai showcase, or simply sit by the pond
where a 17th-century dovecot keeps watch. There’s space here to wander, to wonder,
and to witness a place in the midst of becoming.

### Looking Forward
<p>The history of these estates is long, and not without complexity. But we believe the
future can be one of balance, where local people benefit from healthy land, where
past and present coexist, and where restoration becomes legacy.
</p>
<p>Whether you come to explore, to learn, or to reconnect with nature, there’s a place
for you here. See you soon.
